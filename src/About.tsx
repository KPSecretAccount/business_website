                <p>Growing up the youngest of five in a lower middle class family, everything was a DIY. My dads brains and the helping hands of his kids. I didn't see helping as something to dread but rather found enjoyment in it. I've helped my dad on major projects since I was 8. I've never defined myself as a "girly girl" but rather a girl- now woman- who isn't afraid of following her dreams.</p>
