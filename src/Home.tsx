                <p>Many families want healthier, energy-efficient homes, but most houses on the market are built with
                    outdated methods that waste energy, compromise air quality and ultimately hurt our earth's
                    blueprint. The result? Higher costs, unhealthy living environments and a harmful impact on our
                    planet. Heritage Home Co. fills this gap by designing the home YOU want – prioritizing the planet
                    and people, ultimately offering comfort, long term sustainability and peace of mind.</p>
